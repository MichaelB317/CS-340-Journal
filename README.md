How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I try to follow a minimalist approach. I look for ways to make my code as flexible as I can, while keeping the number of lines of code I right to a minimum. When I wrote my CRUD module, on thing that stuck out to me was that I could adjust the function that connects to the database, to accept the other parameters needed instead of hard coding them. This would allow the CRUD module to function as is with any database in mongodb

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try to take debugging and other problems one step at a time. As long as I can keep taking steps forward, I will eventually reach a solution. The biggest thing I did differently in this course is simply that I reached out to my professor when I reach a road block, or couldn't figure out why I was getting an error. Normally, I would just dig in and keep trying things and looking for possible solutions. I rarely ever reach out for help, and that proved to be a very good change for me.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist, in my opinion work to solve problems, and in this case try to provide the most intuitive and efficient interface they can. I would like to think that my work on this project would allow Grazioso Salvare and their employees to more easily access the mountain of information they have gathered, and hopefully cut down on the amount of time spent sifting through records that do not pertain to their current assignment. It is great to have all of that information at your fingertips, but if you cannot effectively sort and search through it, it becomes a millstone around your neck, making what should be a simple task into a herculean labor.
